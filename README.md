## Features

- **Unified Workplace Knowledge**: Connect to all your workplace apps - Google Workspace, Slack, Confluence, and more. Omni brings together scattered context and knowledge from across your organization into a single, intelligent interface.

- **Privacy-First Architecture**: Your data never leaves your infrastructure. Self-host Omni in your own cloud environment with complete control over your sensitive information.

- **Intelligent Permission Inheritance**: Omni respects and inherits permissions from source systems. Users only see search results and get answers based on data they're already authorized to access.

- **Bring Your Own LLM**: Choose the LLM that fits your needs - connect to Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, or other providers; or use open-weight models via vLLM for complete data privacy. Full flexibility without vendor lock-in.

- **Simple Deployment**: Deploy to your own cloud in minutes using Docker Compose for single-server setups or Terraform templates for production AWS/GCP/Azure deployments. No complex infrastructure required.
